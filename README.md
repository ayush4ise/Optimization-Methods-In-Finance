# Optimization Methods in Finance (MA60269) ðŸ“ˆ

**A collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating optimization techniques applied to real-world financial data.**

## Course Overview
This repository contains the assignments for the graduate-level course *Optimization Methods in Finance (MA60269)*. The notebooks explore various optimization models applied to financial data, focusing on practical implementations using Python.

## Features
- Optimization models including:
  - **Portfolio Optimization** (e.g., mean-variance optimization, risk parity)
  - **Capital Allocation** (e.g., Sharpe ratio maximization)
  - **Risk Management** (e.g., Value at Risk minimization)
- Real-world data for 50 stocks collected from the [BSE website](https://www.bseindia.com/market_data.html).
- Hands-on Jupyter Notebooks with clear explanations and Python code.

## Structure
- `bse_stock_data/`: Contains the original data collected from the BSE website, for a period of 2 years for daily stock prices.
- `outputs/`: Results and visualizations generated by the models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayush4ise/Optimization-Methods-In-Finance.git
``` 

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Key Learnings

This repository demonstrates:
- How to collect, clean, and preprocess financial data.
- Applying optimization techniques to maximize returns or minimize risk.
- Practical usage of Python libraries for solving optimization problems.
